      <p>
        An order can be cancelled any time before it is dispatched. Write to us with
        your order number and we will cancel it and refund the full amount. Once an
        order has been dispatched it can no longer be cancelled, but you may return
        it as described below.

      <p>
        If an item arrives damaged, defective, or is not what you ordered, tell us
        within 7 days of delivery and we will arrange a replacement or a refund.
        Please share photographs of the item and the packaging so we can raise it
        with our courier.

        Items must be unused and returned in their original packaging. For hygiene
        and religious reasons, consumables such as incense, dhoop and camphor cannot
        be returned once opened, unless they arrived damaged.

        process the refund, it typically reaches your account within 5–7 business
